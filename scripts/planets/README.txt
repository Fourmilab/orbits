This directory contains the scripts for the solar system planet
objects.  Each script declares the physical properties of the planet
and its orbital elements, and contains the services required to
interact with the deployer such as moving to a new position or
self-destructing upon receipt of a Remove command.

These scripts should not be confused with the identically- or
similarly-named scripts in the ephemeris directory which contain the
ephemeris calculations for the bodies and reside in the deployer's
inventory.
