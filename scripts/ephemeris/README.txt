This directory contains the planetary theory ephemeris calculators for
the planets of the solar system.  These are included in the Solar
System deployer and invoked by the main script to compute planet
positions when in planetary theory mode.  Don't confuse them with the
scripts included in the individual planet models, whose responsibility
is limited to moving the planets to the positions computed by the
deployer.
