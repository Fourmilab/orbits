[Fourmilab Orbits](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Orbits/????????)
is a model of three kinds of astronomical systems for the Second
Life virtual world.  The models include:

* Bodies in the solar system, including planets, major satellites,
and minor planets (asteroids and comets) specified by their orbital
elements in a variety of public databases.  Models of planets and
moons are included, allowing deployment of authentic scale models
of the solar system.

* Arbitrary n-body systems of masses evolving in space according to
Newtonian gravitation, computed through numerical integration.  A
model of the solar system based upon the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's
state vector is included, demonstrating the stability of our solar
system.

* Objects (infrared sources) orbiting the central black hole of the
Milky Way Galaxy, based upon the most recent published data.

The motion of objects is shown in three-dimensional space, with
optional tracing of the paths of motion, plotting of orbits and
open (parabolic and hyperbolic) trajectories, and fitting of
ellipses to orbits.

This repository contains all of the software and resources,
including programs in Linden Scripting Language, textures,
notecards, and development documentation, tools, and resources
used the model and its development.  The actual model is built
within Second Life and these components are installed within it.

The
[complete package](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Orbits/????????)
is available for free in the Second Life Marketplace.  This
repository contains everything in the model (except the prims,
which are objects built within Second Life), plus additional
resources for developers who may wish to extend or adapt the
model as they wish.  The model is delivered with "full permissions":
those who obtain it are free to copy, modify, and transfer it to
other users within Second Life.
